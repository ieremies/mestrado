  abstract  = {In a graph G = (V, E), S ⊆ Y is a dominating set of G if every vertex is either in S or joined by an edge to some vertex in S. Many different types of domination have been researched extensively. This dissertation explores some new variations and applications of dominating sets. We first introduce the concept of Roman domination. A Roman dominating function is a function f : V → \{0, 1, 2\} such that every vertex v for which f( v) = 0 has a neighbor w with f( w) = 2. This corresponds to a problem in army placement where every region is either defended by its own army or has a neighbor with two armies, in which case one of the two armies can be sent to the undefended region if a conflict breaks out. The weight of a Roman dominating function f is f(V) = ∑ v∈V f(v), and we are interested in finding Roman dominating functions of minimum weight. We explore the graph theoretic, algorithmic, and complexity issues of Roman domination, including algorithms for finding minimum weight Roman dominating functions for trees and grids. We then explore a dynamic variant of domination. Given a graph with each vertex having a sign \{+, −\}, we define a k-threshold process by updating the graph at every time step according to the rule that a vertex switches sign if and only if k or more of its neighbors have the opposite sign. A set S of vertices is a k-conversion set if when a k-threshold process is started with the vertices in S positive and the vertices in V − S negative, the entire vertex set eventually becomes all positive. We prove several bounds on the sizes of minimum k-conversion sets and also explore monotone conversion sets, which are conversion sets where no positive vertex ever becomes negative, and irreversible k-threshold processes, where a vertex changes from − to + if it has more than positive neighbors, but not vice versa. Finally, we discuss a index structure based on dominating sets to speed up range queries on large point sets. Originally developed for searches through libraries of amino acid sequences, the structure can be applied to any library of objects with an associated metric. Some theoretical results are presented, as well as an analysis of the performance of the structure on subsets of the SWISS-PROT protein sequence database.},

The weight of G is the sum of the labels assigned. Roman domination number (RDN) of G, denoted by {\textbackslash}\${\textbackslash}\${\textbackslash}textbackslash gamma{\textbackslash}\_{\textbackslash}\{R{\textbackslash}\} {\textbackslash}textbackslash left( G {\textbackslash}textbackslash right){\textbackslash}\${\textbackslash}\$, is the minimum of the weights of G over all possible RDFs. Finding RDN for a graph is an NP-hard problem. Approximation algorithms and bounds have been identified for general graphs and exact results exist in the literature for some standard classes of graphs such as paths, cycles, star graphs and {\textbackslash}\${\textbackslash}\$2 {\textbackslash}textbackslash times n{\textbackslash}\${\textbackslash}\$grids, but no algorithm has been proposed for the problem for exact results on general graphs in the literature reviewed by us. In this paper, a genetic algorithm has been proposed for the Roman domination problem in which two construction heuristics have been designed to generate the initial population, a problem specific crossover operator has been developed, and a feasibility function has been employed to maintain the feasibility of solutions obtained from the crossover operator. Experiments have been conducted on different types of graphs with known optimal results and on 120 instances of Harwell{\textendash}Boeing graphs for which bounds are known. The algorithm achieves the exact RDN for paths, cycles, star graphs and {\textbackslash}\${\textbackslash}\$2 {\textbackslash}textbackslash times n{\textbackslash}\${\textbackslash}\$grids. For Harwell{\textendash}Boeing graphs, the results obtained lie well within bounds.},
