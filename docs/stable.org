#+title: Stable

In order to keep the algorithm numeric stable, we can solve the MWIS in a graph with integer weights:
\begin{equation*}
\pi_{int} := \floor{K \pi_{float}}.
\end{equation*}
To avoid overflow, we define $K := ulong_{max} / n$.

As mentioned by [cite:@Held12], the dual variables might exceed the interval $[0,1]$.
To combat this, we shift then into the interval before scaling.
